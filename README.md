## :warning: **seebye/ueberzug is not maintained**  

I decided to archive all stuff related to this project  
due to people not being able to comprehend that  
publishing an open source project does not mean that a person is willing to spend their free time on the problems of others.  
Even after disabling issues and disabling pull requests you still get harassed and insulted at some third party sites.  
In my opinion this is really a rude thing to do to a person which was kind enough to share their free time project in case someone else has a use for it.  
I recommend you to stop using this project.
